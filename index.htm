Gnomes are the smallest of all the common races of the world, adults averaging around two and a half feet tall. Most gnomes are quite plump 
in width and weight, being plump is not considered overweight or unhealthy for gnomes as it is the standard for what is necessary and recommended 
to survive. Gnomes most closely resemble dwarves in appearance though through scientific research conduct of course by the gnomes themselves 
revealed the two races to be quite different and distinctly seperate evolutionary. Gnomes have the largest eyes of out of all the common races 
of the land both proportional to their heads and absolutely, this is believed to be due to gnome society living almost entirely underground. Gnomes 
will usually have wide and long noses, pale hair and almost any color eye. Some male gnomes have beards, sometimes extending the full length of 
their bodies. Females differ from the males of the species in quite the same way as human females differ from human males with less defined muscles 
and bone structure, although they do not have large or varying sizes of mammary glands. Gnomes by nature are very inquisitive, often getting them 
into dangerous situations just for the prospects of discovering something interesting. Although intellegence and curiosity are great traits of the 
gnomes, most of them are quite foolish and energetic, would be considered tricksters or pranksters by the other races of the land because they greatly 
enjoy jokes, pranks and the like sometimes at the stake of others enjoyment. Both being silly and intellegent are highly valued traits in gnomish 
society and leaders are often decided based on these traits because the gnomes believe that a leaders intellegence can guide their race forward but 
also a leaders sillyness will keep the people happy and away from wars and unneaded trouble. Gnomish society occurs primarily in self sustaining cities 
underground. The leaders are not decided based on birth or title but on skill, wit, and intellegence. The selection of a leader will occur every few 
years and consist of various competitions of the brain in which an impartial committee judges determines the winners and future rulers. Other than 
just a leader, there will most likely be a board of advisors to leader which is made up of the runners up of the competitions. Gnomes find it hard to 
believe in things that do not have hard evidence and definable properties, therefore gnomes are a godless race as they do not see any proof of the 
existance of gods. The diet of gnomes consist of sustainable food sources in their underground biome which usually includes various grubs and mushrooms, a 
meal most other races would find unappealing.
