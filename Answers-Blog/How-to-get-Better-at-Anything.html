<meta name="description" content="Hello, I'm Mitch, this is where I'm going to post answers to everyday questions that I believe everyone would benefit from 
learning more about. There will be no clear order to my posts, just whatever I feel interested in at the time. I firmly believe 
that the expansion of common knowledge is one of the most important things that we can do as a society. With an increase in 
general knowledge a large amount of societal issues could just fade away. Learning how to get better at anything is probably one of the most important things to learn because it will accelerate all other things that you want to learn thus meaning you can learn more or learn faster.">

Anyone and Everyone has goals in life, and those goals most likely include some sort of skill that can be improved upon to achieve the goal 
faster or more effectively. Getting better at something is very difficult if you don't have direction in doing so. The following points 
suggest a general framework for improving upon some skill and can be applied to almost anything. 
</p>
<p class="subheader">Actually do it</p>
<p>
One of the biggest barriers to improving yourself is a lack of commitment. If you actually want to do something such as get better at 
piano, you will find the time to practice and keep practicing until you achieve the level of skill you want. However, if you struggle 
to find time for something you want to better at, then you probably don't think of it very fondly and have different motivations for 
wanting to improve. Getting into a habit can be one of the most helpful things in this regards because your body and mind will want to 
do it and feel weird if you don't do it when a habit is established. The best way to establish a habit is to force yourself to commit 
the time and do that for a couple of weeks. 
</p>
<p class="subheader">Be consistent</p>
<p>
When trying to get better at something, it is important to keep in mind that you have to be consistent and regular about when you are 
studying the skills or practicing the techniques. There is very little chance that you will get better at something by just spending 
a couple hours each year devoted to it. You need to make sure that you are actually spending the time and learning and improving instead 
of just wasting time learning, then waiting too long, then having to relearn everything again. Its paramount that you keep track of the 
last time you studied or practiced and make sure the time gap isn't too long, its best to keep the maximum amount of time between practice 
at most a week, but for increased improvement definitely keep that time down to 1 to 3 days.
</p>
<p class="subheader">Plan a time and stick to it</p>
<p>
Everyone has various things in their lives that get in the way sometimes and take more time than you want them to. A lot of the time 
people say they are going to do something and then don't because they plan a time and then get interrupted and then maybe they do it 
for a bit but then they get interrupted again and again and just quit because they got out of their habit. The best way to avoid this 
is to not let things interrupt you, if whatever you are trying to accomplish is truly important to you then you will be able to put 
other things aside and get the work done that you want to get done. 
</p>
<p class="subheader">Research</p>
<p>
This may seem obvious but research what you are trying to improve to find the best methods for improvement and for what topics actually 
need to be studied and what things only need a bit of time allocated to them. If too much time is wasted on topics that don't need 
studying, it may end up becoming demotivating and make you want to stop either because it'll become tiresome or because you won't feel 
as though you are improving at all. Planning what to study and practice is almost as important as the actual studying, though it is 
important to make sure that you aren't spending all of your time researching how to improve because it will seem like you are spending 
your time towards your goals when in actuality you are wasting it.
</p>
<p class="subheader">Enjoy it</p>
<p>
The easiest way for you or anyone else to give up on a goal of attaining higher skill in something is by not enjoying it. If you 
ever are in a situation where you want to stay motivated to improve your skills but you don't enjoy the methods to which you are 
improving, you should probably find an alternate method. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a professor in psychology, affirms this in Dee 
Dickinson's book Creating the Future, "It is not that students cannot learn, it is that they do not wish to". He may only be referencing 
the students in school systems but it applies to all and should be taken as a warning, you have to be able to find a method to learn 
whilst enjoying it but it must also be efficient if improvement is wanted. Sometimes finding a learning method like this can be hard, social 
groups with similar goals is helpful but it's difficult to find people like that but there are many internet communities out there. Just 
make sure that the social aspect of it does not get in the way of the far more import learning aspect. 
</p>
<p class="subheader">Avoid Social Media</p>
<p>
If you actually and truly want to improve your abilities in any field, you should do well to avoid social media and telling people 
about your exploits. Peter M. Gollwitzer conducted research about this subject and found that telling people about your plans to do 
something, such as improving your drawing skills, will demotivate you because part of the reward of achieving such a goal is achieved 
without any of the work. You can see the full research article by Peter M. Gollwitzer and his associates <a href="http://www.psych.nyu.edu/gollwitzer/09_Gollwitzer_Sheeran_Seifert_Michalski_When_Intentions_.pdf">here</a>. 
Friends and peers will give out praise for the most minimal and insignificant pieces of work which will make you think "Why would I 
need to improve if everyone already likes what I can do now and I won't even have to put any work in". Also if that is not enough to 
keep you from trying to gain validation from your peers, if you can't motivate yourself to find time to work without knowing that you 
would be able to show it to someone, you probably don't actually want to improve your skills for yourself so there is no point.
