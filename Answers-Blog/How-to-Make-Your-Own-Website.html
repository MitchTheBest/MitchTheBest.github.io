Knowing how to make a website is important for everyone in today's world. So much of our lives are now online 
that having your own space on the internet for resume, expressing yourself, or whatever you feel is a great 
thing. Though most people think that it is impossible for them to do it because there is a bunch of technical 
stuff involved that they have no clue about but actually it is very easy to set up your own website.
</p>
<p class="subheader">Go to a Service</p>
<p>
There are many services out there that can solve all of the issues in making your own website in one fell swoop 
but they usually cost money and cannot provide you with all the freedom in the world to do what you want with 
your website. Most of them entail paying some price and subscription and then it's as easy as dragging and 
dropping what elements you want to where you want them. They will then host your website and keep it up and 
running, taking care of the complicated technical stuff without you completely. The only down side to these services 
is the price and the lack of freedom, otherwise they are very easy and helpful for most people and the website 
projects they have in mind.
</p>
<p class="subheader">Hire someone to make one for you</p>
<p>
Hiring someone is almost as accessible for the average person as just going to a service but it provides lots more 
freedom and opens up a lot in terms of website design and feel because sometime those services can't quite give you 
the perfect thing you are looking for. Of course you will still have to find the perfect way to communicate your 
vision to the person you are hiring to build your site for you but there are easy ways around that like drawing what 
your vision is on a piece of paper. The issue with this method of circumventing creating the website yourself is 
that finding the person for the right freelancer for the job with the right amount of skill and price can be difficult 
or completely unnecessary if your website is small scale or doesn't require a high degree of fine tuning. 
</p>
<p class="subheader">Make it yourself</p>
<p>
Most people would probably say that making a website yourself would be impossible but it is pretty easy if you break it 
down to a few simple steps. The first thing that you have to do is learn how to program in HTML, the language of the 
internet. HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is a tag based language that is very easy to learn, being 
tag based means that there are different elements in an HTML file and how they are differentiated is by different start 
tags and closing tags. After you have learned a little bit of html it is time to start learning how to program in CSS, which 
stands for Cascading Style Sheet, and is needed to make your webpages, that you wrote in HTML, look good. CSS provides all 
of the design to a webpage, without it your webpages would look very boring with each element placed one after another line 
after line all aligned to the left. CSS is more important and more difficult to learn than HTML and you should spend more 
of your time learning it. After you have learned to use those two things, it might be useful to learn some Javascript if 
you want your site to be particularly fancy but isn't required at all if your website is super basic.
</p>
<p>
Once you are done learning everything you need to know about how to make your website and you've made it and you're read 
for the world to be able to see it, you have to find the right domain name. A domain name is basically a name for the location 
of your website such as google.com. There is a server or computer hosting every website on the internet and a domain name is 
just an easy way for us humans to remember where they are instead of having to remember long strings of numbers that are easy 
for the computer to use. There are many places you can buy your own domain name and there are varying prices associated with 
each name and site so just buy it where it's the cheapest because that's all that really matters if you are only buying the 
domain name and not all the dumb package deals that come with. Once you have the domain name you need some method of hosting 
your website which usually costs money per month or money based off of how much traffic your site gets. The option where it 
is based on your sites traffic is usually the best because if you are making this website to have your resume only or something 
similar then chances are almost nobody is going to go to it unless you specifically give them the link and tell them to go. Once 
you've found the right hosting company for you, there will be information on their site how to specifically upload and 
change your files that you want hosted and you will be done and have created your very own website all by yourself.
