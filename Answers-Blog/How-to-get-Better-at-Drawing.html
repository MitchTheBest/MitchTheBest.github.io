<meta name="description" content="Hello, I'm Mitch, this is where I'm going to post answers to everyday questions that I believe everyone would benefit from 
learning more about. There will be no clear order to my posts, just whatever I feel interested in at the time. I firmly believe 
that the expansion of common knowledge is one of the most important things that we can do as a society. With an increase in 
general knowledge a large amount of societal issues could just fade away. Knowing how to create art can be very useful for almost every career, its own career or just a hobby to help reduce stress and relax with.">

			Drawing is a very popular skill to have and sought after by many in their younger years but most never achieve 
			any great level of skill and give up on the idea of learning. This makes those who are experts at drawing a very 
			small group in today's world. Learning to draw well is not easy but anybody can achieve it with time and 
			practice. These few points will help you find direction in your practice and learning process.  
		</p>
		<p class="subheader">Be Consistent</p>
		<p>
			Draw every day or almost all days. Practice takes time and repetition, being consistent with your practice helps 
			it to become a habit and makes it easier to continue on with practice. Malcolm Gladwell once wrote that "ten 
			thousand hours is the magic number of greatness." in his book Outliers, meaning that to become an expert you have 
			to dedicate at least 10,000 hours but by no means does that mean you have learned everything in that field or 
			you can't reach greatness before that point.
		</p>
		<p class="subheader">Practice with Purpose</p>
		<p>
			There are two varying methods or paths you can take when learning how to draw, the brute force method and 
			practicing with purpose. The brute force method involves just spending many many hours drawing whatever 
			you feel like and hope that you will just get better generally with time. This is okay and there is 
			nothing wrong with it if you're not in a rush to get good but your skill may be unbalanced in the different 
			sections and skills within drawing itself. The other method, purposeful practice involves studying the 
			specific fundamentals of drawing and art for speed of development in all of the areas. Practicing with 
			purpose can be many times faster if you have good direction and determination to get better but it is not 
			always the most fun because it can start to feel like homework and you may become demotivated to 
			continue. It is often best to do a mix of the two so that you are drawing the things that are fun and 
			interesting to you while also improving your skills at a quick pace.
		</p>
		<p class="subheader">Be Patient</p>
		<p>
			Patience with honing and improving your skills is the most important ability to possess because becoming 
			disheartened and quitting before reaching your goals is the hardest thing to avoid when learning to 
			draw. Progress will come slowly and it will be difficult to assess how much progress you've made because 
			the pace at which you get better. That's why it's helpful to keep all of your drawings so you can look 
			back a say “holy crap, I was awful when I started” and keep going and progressing.
		</p>
		<p class="subheader">Draw a Lot</p>
		<p>
			Not only do you have to practice your drawing skills consistently, you also have to draw for a couple 
			hours or more each day. Anything less than 1 or 2 hours a day is very hard to improve with because if 
			you take the 10,000 hours frame of thought that would take around 27 years to become great at 
			drawing. This is really where you have to assess how serious you are about learning to draw, the minimum 
			amount of time you should spend each day should vary based on this. If you want to draw professional you 
			should probably spend at least 8 hours a day studying the different skills and techniques needed, maybe 
			more if you don't currently have a job. If you want to get better quickly and are determined, around 4 
			hours a day is recommended. If you want to get better quickly but you have a lot of other stuff to do, 2 
			hours is probably fine. And if you just want to draw and don't care all that much about how fast you are 
			improving, any amount of time should do for your enjoyment.
		</p>
		<p class="subheader">Stick with it</p>
		<p>
			As you can become demotivated with improving how you draw in its entirety, you can also become demotivated 
			over the course of a single piece. In the beginning weeks, months, or even years of learning how to draw, 
			finishing a single drawing can take many hours. As you progress further and further into a drawing, the 
			change over time of the drawing as a whole decreases drastically and it can feel as though you aren't even 
			drawing at all because only tiny details are being changed towards the end. Starting a drawing will start 
			to seem much more enjoyable than finishing a drawing to the end but it is important to learn how to do the 
			details and know how to actually finish a drawing properly. Knowing how to start a drawing is as important 
			as knowing how to finish a drawing.
		</p>
		<p class="subheader">Keep a Sketchbook</p>
		<p>
			Keeping a sketchbook is a must for anyone attempting to get better at drawing, a sketchbook is a catch all 
			for the things an aspiring artist needs. A sketchbook provides a means to judge improvement over a period 
			of time, ample paper to draw on, and a protected place for old drawings. A sketchbook doesn't have to be 
			anything fancy, especially if you aren't intending to show it to anyone, it can be any size and shape and any 
			quality as long as it functions as a group of paper for drawing. Though it should be noted that a small 
			portable sketchbook can be quite useful if you have extra time where you can't do anything else constructive 
			like on the bus or train.
		</p>
		<p class="subheader">Avoid Social Media</p>
		<p>
			If you actually and truly want to get better at drawing, you should do well to avoid social media and telling 
			people about your exploits. Peter M. Gollwitzer conducted research about this subject and found that telling 
			people about your plans to do something, such as improving your drawing skills, will demotivate you because 
			part of the reward of achieving such a goal is achieved without any of the work. You can see the full research 
			article by Peter M. Gollwitzer and his associates <a href="http://www.psych.nyu.edu/gollwitzer/09_Gollwitzer_Sheeran_Seifert_Michalski_When_Intentions_.pdf">here</a>. 
			Friends and peers will give out praise for the most minimal and insignificant pieces of work which will make 
			you think “Why would I need to improve if everyone already likes what I can do now and I won't even have to 
			put any work in”. Also if that is not enough to keep you from trying to gain validation from your peers, if 
			you can't motivate yourself to draw without knowing that you would be able to show it to someone, you probably 
			don't actually want to improve your skills for yourself so there is no point.
