<meta name="description" content="Hello, I'm Mitch, this is where I'm going to post answers to everyday questions that I believe everyone would benefit from 
learning more about. There will be no clear order to my posts, just whatever I feel interested in at the time. I firmly believe 
that the expansion of common knowledge is one of the most important things that we can do as a society. With an increase in 
general knowledge a large amount of societal issues could just fade away. Knowing how to create art can be very useful for almost every career, its own career or just a hobby to help reduce stress and relax with.">

Artistic ability is a very popular skill to have and sought after by many in their younger years but most never 
achieve any great level of skill and give up on the idea of learning. This makes those who are experts in their 
fields of art a very small group in today's world. Learning how to create art well is not easy but anybody can 
achieve it with time and practice. These few points will help you find direction in your practice and learning process.  
</p>
<p class="subheader">Be Consistent</p>
<p>
Paint, Draw, Sculpt every day or almost all days. Practice takes time and repetition, being consistent with your 
practice helps it to become a habit and makes it easier to continue on with practice. Malcolm Gladwell once wrote 
that "ten thousand hours is the magic number of greatness." in his book Outliers, meaning that to become an expert 
you have to dedicate at least 10,000 hours but by no means does that mean you have learned everything in that field 
or you can't reach greatness before that point.
</p>
<p class="subheader">Practice with Purpose</p>
<p>
There are two varying methods or paths you can take when learning artistic skills, the brute force method and practicing 
with purpose. The brute force method involves just spending many many hours creating whatever you feel like and hope that 
you will just get better generally with time. This is okay and there is nothing wrong with it if you're not in a rush to 
get good but your skill may be unbalanced in the different sections and skills within the field of art you are studying. 
The other method, purposeful practice involves studying the specific fundamentals of art for speed of development in all 
of the areas. Practicing with purpose can be many times faster if you have good direction and determination to get better 
but it is not always the most fun because it can start to feel like homework and you may become demotivated to continue. 
It is often best to do a mix of the two so that you are creating the things that are fun and interesting to you while also 
improving your skills at a quick pace.
</p>
<p class="subheader">Be Patient</p>
<p>
Patience with honing and improving your skills is the most important ability to possess because becoming disheartened and 
quitting before reaching your goals is the hardest thing to avoid when learning to create art. Progress will come slowly 
and it will be difficult to assess how much progress you've made because the pace at which you get better. That's why it's 
helpful to keep all of your work cataloged so you can look back a say "holy crap, I was awful when I started" and keep progressing and improving.
</p>
<p class="subheader">Draw a Lot</p>
<p>
Not only do you have to practice your artistic skills consistently, you also have to spend a couple hours or more each day 
creating. Anything less than 1 or 2 hours a day is very hard to improve with because if you take the 10,000 hours frame of 
thought that would take around 27 years to become great at but one area of art. This is really where you have to assess how 
serious you are about learning artistic skills, the minimum amount of time you should spend each day should vary based on 
this. If you want to be a professional artist, you should probably spend at least 8 hours a day studying the different 
skills and techniques needed, probably more if you don't currently have a job. If you want to get better quickly and are 
determined, around 4 hours a day is recommended. If you want to get better quickly but you have a lot of other stuff to do, 2 
hours is probably fine. And if you just want to create whatever you want and don't care all that much about how fast you are 
improving, any amount of time should do for your enjoyment.
</p>
<p class="subheader">Stick with it</p>
<p>
As you can become demotivated with improving your artistic ability in its entirety, you can also become demotivated over the 
course of a single piece. In the beginning weeks, months, or even years of learning any art, finishing a single piece can take 
many hours. As you progress further and further into a piece, the change over time of the piece as a whole decreases drastically 
and it can feel as though you aren't even changing it at all because only tiny details are being changed towards the end. Starting 
a piece will start to seem much more enjoyable than finishing the piece to the end but it is important to learn how to do the 
details and know how to actually finish a piece properly. Knowing how to start a piece is as important as knowing how to finish it.
</p>
<p class="subheader">Keep a Sketchbook</p>
<p>
Keeping a sketchbook is a must for anyone attempting to improve their artistic ability, a sketchbook is a catch all for the things 
an aspiring artist needs, even if the field you wish to study isn't 2D based. A sketchbook provides a means to judge improvement 
over a period of time, ample paper to draw on, and a protected place for old drawings, and a place to get ideas out on paper to be 
refined. A sketchbook doesn't have to be anything fancy, especially if you aren't intending to show it to anyone, it can be any size 
and shape and any quality as long as it functions as a group of paper for drawing. Though it should be noted that a small portable 
sketchbook can be quite useful if you have extra time where you can't do anything else constructive like on the bus or train.
</p>
<p class="subheader">Avoid Social Media</p>
<p>
If you actually and truly want to improve your artistic ability, you should do well to avoid social media and telling people about 
your exploits. Peter M. Gollwitzer conducted research about this subject and found that telling people about your plans to do 
something, such as improving your drawing skills, will demotivate you because part of the reward of achieving such a goal is achieved 
without any of the work. You can see the full research article by Peter M. Gollwitzer and his associates <a href="http://www.psych.nyu.edu/gollwitzer/09_Gollwitzer_Sheeran_Seifert_Michalski_When_Intentions_.pdf">here</a>. 
Friends and peers will give out praise for the most minimal and insignificant pieces of work which will make 
you think "Why would I need to improve if everyone already likes what I can do now and I won't even have to put any work in". Also if 
that is not enough to keep you from trying to gain validation from your peers, if you can't motivate yourself to find time to work 
without knowing that you would be able to show it to someone, you probably don't actually want to improve your skills for yourself so 
there is no point.
