Most of the time, nobody really considers the worst heroes in Doat because they think that they never have to worry about them because nobody will play them. Everyone, considers the worst 
heroes to be the ones with the lowest win rates out of all the heroes but most of the time I would consider that primarily because of a lack of knowledge of how to play the hero. Meepo, Visage, 
Io, Lone Druid, are all heroes that have low winrates and are considered to be difficult because of their strange play styles to even use them properly. I would say that none of these heroes are 
the worst but a hero that is picked quite often and most people would say they know how to play, Legion Commander.
</p>
<p>
Legion Commander, is one of the most popular heroes in Dota because of her fun and rewarding play style and abilities, but is also one of the worst heroes because of her play style and abilities. 
Legion Commander is best considered a ganker hero that can function in any of the core roles if necessary but isn't spectacular in any of them. She doesn't function well in a lane when contested 
because her lack of armor and because she doesn't have mana to support her abilities to be spammed. Legion Commander has little kill potential in lane without another hero that has some sort of 
stun or slow because she does not have one herself until she gets her ultimate. Legion can be zoned out of lane very easily but can do the same easily to her opposing laner if she has momentum or 
a little bit of support. The early game for Legion isn't the worst but her laning is just bad enough and her jungling potential is just good enough that people often take to the jungle from level 
1 even though most reputable sources say that jungling is one of the easiest ways to lose a game.
</p>
<p>
Once Legion Commander gets her ultimate, her play style completely changes which is why I consider her one of the worst heroes in Dota. Legion's ultimate, as you probably know, allows her to force 
her target into a duel state where the victor gets bonus damage. This ability alone makes her ganking potential ridiculous with some sort of initiation tool such as a blink dagger or shadow blade. 
Though people often mistake a succesful duel as good enough for a gank and usually neglesct to accomplish anything after the gank because they think "Oh, I got more damage, the late game is secured" 
or something like that. This is where the issue arises because people will just farm on her until her ultimate is off cooldown but since legion commander farms so slowly and can't push very fast, time 
is wasted. Legion commander also is a hero that needs so many items to have any effect in the mid to late game. She is easily kited by any ranged core with a slow and easily killable in her ultimate 
or when engaging the enemy team in general because she has no built in slow/stun or good mobility tool. Every time a Legion Commander initiates, she is instantly focused and quickly taken down even though 
she may get the damage bonus so it's "#worth" it's usually Legion Commander's life for an enemy support which is not worth because Legion is usually given some sort of farm priority and has to have 
some sort of farm to be at least a little effective.
</p>
<p>
In short, Legion Commander is one of the worst heroes in Dota 2 because she needs a lot of farm to be effective into the late game but farms inefficiently, she needs to achieve a lot in the early game 
but needs a ton of assistance from supports and does everything too inefficiently. Legion Commander, can stomp games but none the less is one of the heroes in Dota 2.
