There are many items in Dota 2 and even more possible item builds for each hero. Every hero has their specific meta build for each hero and most people don't stray to far away from those builds for 
whatever reason they have. There are some items that function perfectly on every hero but are rarely bought because they don't fit with the current meta build but can always fit into the build. One 
such item is Linken's Sphere, it is a great defensive item that allows heroes to be more offensive to lead their team to victory.
</p>

<p>
On cores, its quite clear why some of them want Linken's Spheres, they want to be able to jump into the middle of a fight and not get stunned so they can get situated and hopefully take out a few heroes 
before sufficient lockdown is applied to them. Though, you might be thinking, "thats the exact reason people buy Black King Bars and those allow more free movement within a fight than a Linken's Sphere". 
This is true but there are some key differences between what they provide, so one is not necessarily better in all situations. BKB, has the effect that you will be unable to be targetted by most spells 
and as the core, this is good but for supports who maybe dont have BKBs this is bad because they will get focused while the core's BKB is active and if the core hero can't get enough done within that time 
the fight is essentially lost. But with a Linken's Sphere, the enemy team's disablers will have to use 2 of their targettable abilities to stop you from killing them but those are 2 spells not used on your 
allies. Also on top of all that, a BKB has a long cooldown and diminishing returns with use so you can easily be kited during the duration and then focused afterwards if your team doesn't survive as well. 
So depending on the enemy team, Linken's Sphere can be a great alternative to BKB because it makes you more tanky but your allies don't suffer in the process but thrive.
</p>

<p>
On a support hero, the effects of a Linken's are quite the same except in reverse and may have adverse effects if not played properly. Since the support has the Linken's Sphere in this situation, they will 
automatically be harder to kill because of the lack of lockdown, most heroes only have 1 form of lockdown each so you will need 2 heroes to try and jump on you and quickly take you down before you can 
contribute. A Linken's Sphere can also be cast on allies so you can essential boost the GPM of your carry by 5000 gold (if you live long enough to continually apply it to them of course). This casting 
ability of the Linken's is great for all purposes, when pushing, when team fighting, when trying to save someone. 
</p>

<p>
In short, Linken's Sphere can be a great alternative for BKB in many cases because it is more reliable, more team friendly, and has more utility. It is a useful item for all members of the team and no matter 
who buys it, it will improve the overall tankiness of the team by eliminating possible spells to be used on the owner of the Linken's or their teammate. Everyone should reconsider if their item builds have 
an open slot for a possible Linken's in any potential game or any potential hero.
