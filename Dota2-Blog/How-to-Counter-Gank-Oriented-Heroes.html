<meta name="description" content="Hello, I'm Mitch, I am an average Dota player who believes that he has a high level of understand of the game and all of its components but lacks the skill to utilize the knowlegde 
or is just dumb and bad at the game. With this blog I hope to try and spread various ideas about the game that slip by the average player and get lost in the overwhelmingly boring 
public meta game. Not everything I say should be taken as fact or even as quality, probably everything I say is pure crap but that doesn't matter because I have a passion for the 
game and love to theorize about different and unexplored aspects of the meta game.">

One of the most common complaints that you here in low skill matches of Dota 2 is that heroes such as Slark, Riki, Pudge, ect. are broken and need to be nerfed because they stomp games often. This is a mindset 
issue that all players need to get past in order to get better at the game if they are in these low tier games. All of the "pub stomp" heroes that people complain about all usually have one thing in common, 
they all excel and benefit from ganking often. Whether it be Pudge, Riki, Bounty Hunter, they all have easy methods for ganking often and without warning for the inexperienced player and make it difficult to 
do the things necessary to achieve victory. All of these issues stem from a lack of knowledge of how to properly farm and support for whatever position you are playing.
</p>
<p>
An inexperienced support player with an inexperienced team can easily cost the whole game by not positioning themselves properly and providing the necessary vision and protection for their core heroes. As the 
support, you are expected and should by out all of the observer wards and promptly place them all game. Just simply warding key points on the map throughout the game, a support player can easily shut down an 
enemy pudge who does not have a way to get past unseen unless he gets a fortuitous rune or used a smoke which both have limits to how much they can be used and cost something extra to the ganker. Simply warding 
and dewarding enemy wards will signifigantly reduce the effectiveness of enemy ganks from non-invisible heroes. For invisible heroes it is very important to buy ample sentry wards and dust. In the beginning of 
game, it is important for the supports to provide defensive sentry wards in every lane to make sure that ganks from invisible heroes are stumped early on and they don't get valuable momentum. Dust should also be 
bought in the early game so that ganking invisible heroes is easier or possible which will make them think twice about ganking or staying in lane. Into the mid and late game, it is always important to place sentries 
along with your observer wards to keep track of their movements across the map, as well as keeping extra sentries and dust for when team fights break out. As a support, you should always be warding but when faced 
with an enemy team composed of gank oriented heroes it is extra important and necessary.
</p>
<p>
Core players have equally important responsibilities for when facing a gank oriented line up. The core heroes have to know when it is safe to farm, safe to fight, and safe to push. A good rule to follow for if you 
are a core player is that if no enemy heroes are visible and haven't been for 15-30 seconds you are probably being ganked. Of course, the more vision the team has, the more likely you will be able to notice potential 
gank attempts. Though, inversely if the enemy team has the vision advantage, you have to compensate and be even more careful than if they had no vision because they will have more information on which fights are safe 
to take. With pushing it is important to know where the enemy team is but also whether or not the enemies have tp scrolls which can easily be attained by vision. Keeping track of the enemy team, whether or not they are 
together or what key items they have will also allow you to know when and where to fight.
</p>
<p>
Many of the considered over powered heroes of low MMR games all have their weakness. It is important for players to adjust their mindset and playstyle instead of just blaming the developers when they could be learning 
how to counter them. Proper wards and skilled decision making can dramatically change the outcome of many different Dota matches.
