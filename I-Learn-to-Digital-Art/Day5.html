This painting is sort of a piece of fan art for the game dark souls because it is heavily based off of a character in Dark Souls 1 but not exactly the same. It took me around 3 and a half hours 
to bring to this state which is good because I actually was able to spend at least a decent amount of time on it unlike last painting. This painting has a lot of the same issues as painting 3, I'm 
still having an issue with the shading and lack of perspective causing the image to look flat. I think part of that is because I didn't finish my shading because I was getting frustrated and annoyed. 
My plan was to focus on the details of the shield, shoulder, and arm brace but the way that I was attempting to didn't feel like it was working at all so I got very hasty and made the shield look 
horrible compared to the rest of the painting which is disappointing because I didn't try.

<p class="subheader">Likes</p>
<ol>
<li>I like the light and shade of where I actually did it to a complete state</li>
<li>The mask turned out as good as I wanted and hoped that it would</li>
</ol>
<p class="subheader">Dislikes</p>
<ol>
<li>I started to get frustrated and it is clearly visible where I was working on in those moments</li>
<li>I didn't spend enough time planning and with line work</li>
<li>I quit with the painting prematurely</li>
<li>All of my paintings so far have the too clean digital look and they are not executed good enough for that to look good yet</li>
</ol>
<p>
I plan on doing some sort of environment painting next where I only use one layer and don't start with very much line art so I can try to be more fluid and have a painterly looking outcome.
