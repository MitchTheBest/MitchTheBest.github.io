<meta name="description" content="Hello, I'm Mitch, I want to learn how to properly and effectively create art with a computer and a pen tablet digital drawing tool. I've always had a 
dream of become an artist and then now thats transitioned into having a dream about being a concept artist which changed into I just want to be able to be 
good at art as a hobby. I would like to strive for a painting or two a day which I post here so that I can see my progress easily time lined and maybe 
others could also see how unskilled I am at first and then motivate themselves to improve. This is my day 3 painting I did of a weird reaper astronaut.">

Once again, you can see that I did not finish the painting for today because of time issues and just being 
tired because I have a lot of homework from college but it's fine because at least im doing something. I liked the 
ideas I had for this painting but they never came to light because I stopped painting. This was around 3-4 hours of 
work so I think I'm getting slightly more used to the shading/highlighting technique I used from the last painting
but it's still not great because the image still appears flat. This is probably because I lack the knowledge of how 
light and color work and interact.
</p>
<p class="subheader">Likes</p>
<ol>
<li>I like the design and the ideas I had but i couldn't excecute them properly</li>
<li>I like the skull but when I tried to add little details I messed it up because they were too harsh</li>
</ol>
<p class="subheader">Dislikes</p>
<ol>
<li>The handle of the scythe is meant to look like a spinal cord but instead of using reference, I drew from my head and it doesn't look like a spinal cord at all</li>
<li>There is no texture, everything looks like a completely smooth form</li>
<li>The shading on the bottom part of the scythe blade doesn't have the same light source as the other parts of the image</li>
<li>I did not complete the painting</li>
<li>The visor of the space helmet appears especially flat as well as the whole image, which I assume because my lighting and shading isn't quite right</li>
<li>There is no perspective so all the objects in the image seem in the same plane but I wanted the scythe to appear over the shoulder</li>
</ol>
<p>
I'm unsatisfied in my efforts to get better, I'm not putting all I can into it which is acceptable I guess because I am in college. 
Though I have more free time but am using it to do other things that are less productive in my opinion but it's not always necessary 
to be working towards something because that builds up stress so I don't know. I have multiple books that I plan to reread that will 
be very useful for what I am trying to learn about and since when I read those books for the first time, I didn't put what I was 
reading to use so I probably didn't absorb all the info that i could. The issue is that the books are at my house so it'll be a while 
until I can get access to them.
