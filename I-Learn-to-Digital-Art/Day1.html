<meta name="description" content="Hello, I'm Mitch, I want to learn how to properly and effectively create art with a computer and a pen tablet digital drawing tool. I've always had a 
dream of become an artist and then now thats transitioned into having a dream about being a concept artist which changed into I just want to be able to be 
good at art as a hobby. I would like to strive for a painting or two a day which I post here so that I can see my progress easily time lined and maybe 
others could also see how unskilled I am at first and then motivate themselves to improve. This is my day 1 painting I did of some sort of fighter jet.">

So this is the first painting of this endeavour, overall I am pretty happy with the result, as it is better than anything 
I expected that i would beable to create at this time. I spent around 2 to 3 hours which I realize that I could've spent 
much more time on it but at that point I felt as though I didn't know how to proceed with anything and I was getting frustrated 
with my lack of skill and knowledge so I thought it would be best if I just stopped so that I would feel like continuing 
and learning tomorrow. I plan on watching some quick tutorial videos to see if I can rectify some technique errors early. Now 
I'm gonna go through the painting and describe what I like and dislike about the piece.
</p>
<p class="subheader">Likes</p>
<ol>
<li>The overall quality, I feel like for a first painting, it's a great start</li>
<li>The complexity of the image and form seem pretty good for a start</li>
</ol>
<p class="subheader">Dislikes</p>
<ol>
<li>The shading and highlights, I did not know how to properly or easily blend so the way that I was trying was painful and slow with a poor result</li>
<li>The perspective is a bit off, you can easily tell by comparing the two engines, the one that's suppose to be further is much longer and some other issues</li>
<li>The overall value of the painting, it doesnt read well because I didn't think about that before starting</li>
<li>I decided to stop when I knew that I could of continued and tried to add more and refine further but I didn't because I was getting annoyed</li>
<li>And then a bunch of little stuff</li>
</ol>
<p>
Overall, I had a good time with this painting and hope that I can keep to it and see my improvement over the weeks to come. I now realize that complications may arrive 
with doing a painting everyday since I am also a fulltime student and seeing as this one painting took me 3 hours and it is very minimal, I might have to limit the time 
I spend on each painting or just not do it everyday, which will mean that I will improve slower but thats fine for a hobbyist anyways, as long as I'm doing something.
