I am very proud of this painting because I can see the improvement and I'm spending more time on them now so they look more finished and I'm very motivated. I spent around 
8 hours on this one, using the same technique as before where I only use one layer and have little to no line drawing. There are many parts of it that I don't like because 
I was having trouble with the perspective of the face for a long time during the painting process and I kept changing it over and over and wasn't happy so different parts 
have differing levels of completion and it doesn't really come together as a whole. Also, midway through, I discovered a new way to shade and have more detail so I was 
experimenting with it in different parts and I think it doesn't look unified because of that.

<p class="subheader">Likes</p>
<ol>
<li>The color choices even though they look off</li>
<li>The fur neck scarf is nice but is much worse than before because I had to redo it and i didn't put enough effort in the second time</li>
</ol>
<p class="subheader">Dislikes</p>
<ol>
<li>The colors look to desaturated and muddy</li>
<li>I didn't try and stick with painting the eyes because I couldn't get them to work in the first few minutes</li>
<li>The face and skin has no real shading so looks strange and flat next to everything else</li>
<li>The horns are too smooth and the shading isn't very accurate</li>
<li>The hair doesn't look right, it's supposed to be clean and curled but it doesn't even look like hair</li>
</ol>
<p>
For my next painting I would like to do an interior so that I have to focus on perspective heavily if I want it to look good at all. I don't know if I want 
to continue using the style of no layers and little line drawing because it seems slow and overly difficult because I kept having to paint the same areas 
over again.
