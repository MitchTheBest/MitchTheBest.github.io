With this second painting, I can already tell that I improved quite a bit from just watching a few digital art technique videos. Though, as you can plainly see,
the painting is not finished, only the dragon is "finished". This painting took way too long being about 6-8 hours just to do what's there which is quite ridiculous 
but the slow work time comes with learning I hear and there is no good way around it unless I want to sacrifice my learning. I still struggle with detail and don't really
know how to go about it so I'm just not even trying which is bad because I'll never learn if I don't try. I also find it difficult to shade/highlight when multiple colors 
are in the same areas. I do have an idea to fix this though, which would be having 2 layers for what is now 1, a color and value layer but I feel that might make the 
feel of the painting less organic and fluid which is never good unless it's meant to be so. Things that I tried this time to see if I could help improve the process was the use 
of a clipping mask for different parts of the image and then the use of the more natural looking shading method.

<p class="subheader">Likes</p>
<ol>
<li>The dedication to attempting to complete it by working for 6-8 hours on it</li>
<li>The shading, it's better than the last painting's but still not at where I want it to be</li>
</ol>
<p class="subheader">Dislikes</p>
<ol>
<li>The color choices</li>
<li>The lack of detail</li>
<li>It is incomplete</li>
<li>The form of the dragon</li>
</ol>
<p>
There are clearly a lot of things that I still need to work on but for the next painting I plan on picking something to draw 
that forces me to try to include detail, so maybe something on a smaller scale like a leaf. I would like to find a way to paint 
faster but hear that amateurs who try to speed paint is bad practice because you need to take time when you're learning so I don't
know what I'm going to do about my time but I sure will try to continue as is for now.
