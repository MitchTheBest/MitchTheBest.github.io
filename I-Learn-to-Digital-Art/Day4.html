I didn't have much time to spend working on Digital Art in the past couple days but I wanted to make and upload something so this is a short sketch of two things from the game
Chrono Trigger, the right and middle pieces, and another made up mech vehicle concept. This took about 45 mins to make which I am ashamed of because I've said that I shouldn't be 
focusing on finishing a painting or how long it takes me to finish one but the process and getting a good outcome. Though this was all I could really do in the past couple days which 
is upsetting because I would like it if I could continue to do my hobbies while doing all of my school work but it seems as though I'm going to have to sacrifice my hobbies for a while. 
I like more than I dislike about this piece because there isn't much to dislike when it isn't even partially developed.

<p class="subheader">Likes</p>
<ol>
<li>How simply I could (poorly) represent form with simple/minimal light and shade</li>
<li>The design of the mech vehicle on the left</li>
<li>The purple tinted glass on the mech, I didn't have any idea on how to do something transparent but I tried and I think I know how to improve upon my attempt already</li>
</ol>
<p class="subheader">Dislikes</p>
<ol>
<li>The lack of time and effort I put in today</li>
</ol>
<p>
For my next painting,  I think that I'm going to plan it out on paper first so I have an idea of what I want the output to look like in a medium I am comfortable with and just try to 
match it as close as possible. This probably means that it is going to be some kind of character similar to Day 3's painting because I am not very good at landscapes/environments and 
I don't feel like doing anything involving too much perspective just yet because my line work is still bad. I'm going to have to force myself to master the fundamentals eventually but 
I would prefer to do that when I have more free time so for now I'm just going to try and have fun with it and keep going.
