I didn't have too much fun with this one because it didn't really interest me enough and I didn't have much time to work on 
something so I decided to do this as something quick and easy but I think it's an overall failure. This piece is practice 
rendering hair which I would say is somewhat succesful but not to the level I was hoping for because I didn't spend enough 
time or effort on it. The first one is just a dry run attempt where I attempted to render hair based off of my idea of hair 
using no references or guides which turned out horribly but it's okay because it highlights where and how I can improve. The 
second one I used reference and a guide from a YouTube tutorial which I would say is the most succesful out of the bunch 
which is bad because it's only the second attempt. The third and fourth are both taking what I learn and trying to apply it 
without reference and they both turned out horribly. For the fifth hair painting, I used what I learned from all the previous 
paintings and also used reference so it is good but not as good as the second which is disheartening. I wanted to do this because 
the hair in the Day 7 painting was very lack luster and was upsetting me because I didn't know how to go about it.

<p class="subheader">Likes</p>
<ol>
<li>I learned a little bit about rendering hair, I figured out that you are suppose to go with the largest sections first and then continuely wark smaller and smaller until it looks good</li>
</ol>
<p class="subheader">Dislikes</p>
<ol>
<li>I didn't improve at all in the third, fourth or fifth attempts</li>
<li>I should of spent more time on this and tried using more photo reference</li>
<li>I didn't think of hair as just any other form and tried to apply special rules to it</li>
</ol>
<p>
I did not enjoy this so I definitly want to try and do something more fun as to avoid quitting all together. I like mythical creatures and fantasy so 
my next piece will probably be in that realm because those topics I can always enjoy.
