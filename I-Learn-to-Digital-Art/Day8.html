I wanted to do an interior for this painting but I ran out of time so I wasn't able to get to the detailing phase which is the reason I wanted to do the interior in the first place. 
The plan was to make a wizards study that was cluttered so that I would have to detail everything out so it could be understandable. I also wanted to attempt to use a more interesting 
lighting method were the light source was in frame (the chandelier) and a specific color. I plan on coming back to this painting in the future because I really like the design and ideas 
I had for it but they were never realized so I'm upset. The perspective gave me a few issues because as you can see the line art doesn't align with the color because the original line 
art was off in some places and I had to fix it many different times because I didn't notice for a while.
</p>
<p class="subheader">Likes</p>
<ol>
<li>The design and my future plans</li>
<li>I got myself to draw actual perspective lines even though they were poor and that it's only 1 point perspective</li>
</ol>
<p class="subheader">Dislikes</p>
<ol>
<li>There are perspective errors still</li>
<li>The line art is sort of useless because its perspective wasn't even right and doesn't have all the details I was planning on adding later</li>
<li>The large book's bottom feels weird in perspective even though I tried to fix it multiple times</li>
<li>I feel as though I am spending way too much time on the little things like keeping a line straight instead of focusing on the big picture</li>
</ol>
<p>
I'm not quite sure what I'm going to do for my next painting but I'm thinking about doing some sort of study so I see some improvement in a specific area but I don't know 
what and I don't want it to be long and boring. I've been only doing fun stuff thus far because I want to be able to stay motivated to keep working at it and improving 
because I know it's easiest to quit when you aren't seeing any improvement and not having fun.
