This piece, I am very proud of because I spent a long time working on it but also achieved a good result compared to my previous work thus far. I used the method I talked about in my 
last post where I don't use much of a line drawing and no layers and I think it turned out fantastic. It's supposed to be a rope bridge crossing a chasm and leading into a meadow towards 
some sort of mega structure but I don't know how well I conveyed it because this is the first time I've ever created any sort of landscape. I also wanted there to be a rugged looking 
traveler on the bridge but I didn't like how it was turning out so I painted over it. I spent about 8 hours on this but towards the end I became very hasty and made many parts look worse 
like the spire and the forest. I didn't add much detail at all, the most detail in this piece is the little blades of grass that I put next to the boulders and pushes but that's almost nothing.

<p class="subheader">Likes</p>
<ol>
<li>The result of the painting overall</li>
<li>I really like the rocks and the hills</li>
</ol>
<p class="subheader">Dislikes</p>
<ol>
<li>When trying to add some atmospheric perspective I was too hasty</li>
<li>The forest looks weird, I don't know how I am supposed to represent a mass of trees or their leaves</li>
<li>The spire in the distance makes the whole painting look bad because I rushed it</li>
</ol>
<p>
For my next painting, I would like to try the same method of using no layers and little use of line drawing but with a subject that allows and requires more details because I would like to try and 
get in the habit of doing details and finishing my paintings to a more complete looking state because all of them so far have looked as though they were unfinished. So I was thinking of doing some 
sort of portrait but I feel like it may end horribly if I don't push myself to bring it to a far enough state.
